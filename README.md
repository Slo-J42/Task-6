## üß™ Tested Passwords

| Password            | Complexity Features                             | Strength Score | Notes                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `password123`       | Lowercase + Numbers                              | 32%            | Too common and predictable.                      |
| `P@ssw0rd!`         | Mixed case + Symbols + Numbers                   | 62%            | Better, but still resembles common patterns.     |
| `Gx#84tLmR@92$`     | Strong entropy, symbols, mix of characters       | 100%           | Excellent randomness and strength.               |
| `ILoveCoffee!2025`  | Passphrase style with number and symbol          | 78%            | Memorable yet strong.                            |
| `zY!2r9b@T*QmX`     | 13 characters, high entropy                      | 95%            | Very strong, great for secure systems.           |

## üß† Key Learnings
- Longer passwords (12+ chars) drastically increase security.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid using real words, names, or common patterns.
- Passphrases can be both secure and easier to remember.
- Use a password manager to store complex passwords.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Attack Methods

| Attack Type           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force            | Tries all character combinations. Long, complex passwords resist this well. |
| Dictionary Attack      | Uses lists of common passwords and words.                                   |
| Credential Stuffing    | Reuses stolen credentials across services.                                  |
| Social Engineering     | Exploits human behavior to guess passwords.                                 |

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Always enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- Avoid reusing passwords across services.
- Change passwords regularly.
- Test passwords using trusted tools before using them.
- Check for compromised passwords at [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com).
